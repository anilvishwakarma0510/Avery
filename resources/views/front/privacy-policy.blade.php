			A Privacy Policy is a legal statement found on a website or app that outlines explicit details on how it will use personal data provided by users. Such personal data may include details like names, addresses, phone numbers, date of birth or data related to one's financial information like credit card details.</p>

			<p class="fs_22 fs_sm_16 fw_4 text-color">Other than outlining how your website will use the data, a Privacy Policy also describes the legal obligations you have if you fail to meet stipulated responsibilities as the website owner.</p>

		<p class="fs_20 fs_sm_16 fw_4 text-color">The content of your Privacy Policy will largely depend on the function of your website, the information gathered and how you intend to use said information. However, to pass legal standards, all Privacy policies should have these basic elements within the text.</p>

		<p class="fs_20 fs_sm_16 fw_4 text-color">In addition to filling out forms, you can also collect data automatically through the use of cookies. Internet cookies are, by far, the easiest way to collect user data since browsers collect and save information from an array of sites users have previously visited. However, you must also obtain consent from users to use their cookies when collecting information.</p>

		<p class="fs_20 fs_sm_16 fw_4 text-color">A vital element of a Privacy Policy is describing how you intend to use the data collected. This clause is particularly important if third-parties like advertising programs or fintech companies are in the loop.</p>

		<p class="fs_20 fs_sm_16 fw_4 text-color">Will you use the data for transactional purposes alone or will you also send newsletters to your visitors? Will your company share information with other third-party entities like merchants? If so, the law legally requires you to list down all the relevant parties who will also have access to user information alongside your business.</p>

		<p class="fs_20 fs_sm_16 fw_4 text-color">Security Measures in Place to Protect Data <br>
Perhaps the most crucial clause in a Privacy Policy, website owners should give details of the security safeguards they have in place to keep customers' and visitors' personal information safe. <br>

The industry-standard safety measure for protecting private information is the use of a Secure Socket Layers (SSL) system. With SSLs, information fed into a website by users is automatically encrypted and coded, which prevents a breach during transmission.<br>

You're free to integrate as many security measures as you want as long as malicious parties or unrestricted personnel can't intercept or have access to user information.<br>

Here's how Bath and Body Works explained its security measures in place. It doesn't go too technical on what they do, but its description manages to assure customers that their details are safe:<br>

		As a business owner, you should also let your users know how long you intend to keep their information in your database.</p>
